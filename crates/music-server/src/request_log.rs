//! What the studio asked a cloud provider, and what came back.
//!
//! A request that goes wrong leaves the user with one red line and no way to
//! find out more: the answer is gone the moment the window is closed, and a
//! model that wrote something almost right is indistinguishable from one that
//! wrote nothing. So every call is written down - what was asked, how long it
//! took, what came back, and the answer itself when it could not be used.
//!
//! Two rules hold this to something safe to keep on disk. The key is never
//! written, not even in part; and the file is trimmed rather than allowed to
//! grow, because a log nobody can open is a log nobody reads.
